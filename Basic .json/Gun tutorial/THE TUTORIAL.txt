                                                     How to edit basic .json files! 


  Hey guys! So you want to make a weapon, or a cool backpack, or maybe fix a missing tile in your game. Well don't worry I will try to 
show you how! 

  Okay so number one, you have a basic text editor like notepad++ or any other text editor you may use. 

>JSON FILE #1   So lets start with something easy. Lets say you want to make a new gun. 

1.) First always have an idea of what your gun is going to be. An AR style? a shotgun? Look for an example on BN github. 
at the top left of the screen you'll see a search bar. We will be doing a new AR style rifle. What caliber is your rifle going
to be? For this gun we will do a .223 style rifle. 

(note- the file structure for the guns in BN is based on caliber to make it easy.)

  So we are going to look at .233.json located in this mod and right click and open with the text editor.

  In this file is one gun that is currently on BN. This is just for your reference to look at when making your new gun.
Leave this open while you make your new gun as well. 

  Now right click the example .json #1 and You'll notice this gun has no stats or everything is at one. This is for you to tweak and mess
around with. 

Now look at EXAMPLE #2

  This is a gun that I just made using the template from example #1 Now you try! I usually look up the stats of the weapon I'm trying to,
make. So I looked up a wood furniture AR. That's where I got the weight from, and the other stats.
